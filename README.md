# Project2_MN
 This is a final project I completed for my programming 2 course at Cincinnati State. I used VB.NET and Microsoft SQL Server to create it.

The application allows users to log in as either a customer or employee. Login credentials that the user enters will be queried against the database and will only allow access if it is a match. Customers can complete actions such as updating personal information, adding themselves to future flights, or showing their past and future flight statistics. Employees who are either a pilot or attendant can update their information or view their past/future flight statistics. Employees who are admins can add new employees, create future flights, add employees to future flights for scheduling purposes, or delete any employee. There is also a statistics form that shows some basic statistics for the company based on current information in the database.
